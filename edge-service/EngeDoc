# Edge Server
The outside world can't talk to Eureka server to find proper services. so we add and edge server
that is exposed to the outside world. the request from the clients come to this server and then redirected
to proper end-point. Edge server has also another benefits which is to perform all the security checks
(authenticate) requests befor letting them in the inside network.

There are two types of edge server:
* MicroProxy: gets the outside world requests and reSends them to inside network. (@EnableZuulProxy)
* Api Gateway: gets the outside world requests and modifies and Sends them to inside network.
